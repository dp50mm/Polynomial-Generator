# Polynomial Generator

I made this small coding exercise in generating and visualising Polynomials while going through the book [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org/).

Exercise is bootstrapped with create-react-app. To run the code:

 _yarn install_

 and then

 _yarn run_

 and it should open a browser window.
